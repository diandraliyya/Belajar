        <aside>
            <p class="desc">This place sells many kind of dimsums, such as siomay, kuotie, lumpia ayam, etc. Besides that, you can also try their mie ayam jamur. For me the mie ayam jamur is sooo good. If you come here don't forget to try the chilli oil cuz it also tastes super good. The foods here are a little bit pricy, so you guys better prepare more budget if you wanna go here.</p>

            <p class="desc">You guys must have known this place for its viral cookie bomb. The cookie bomb is yummy, but i guess it'll be too sweet if you're not a sweettooth so you better share it with your friend. It actually sells fudgy brownies with many flavours, from sweet to bitter, you can try yourself cause their brownies are also really delicious. My other favorite is the softbro. Softbro is actually ice cream mixed with their yummy brownies. It will give you new experience of eating brownie. The must try one is actually the softbro guys, please try it when you go here! </p>

        <p class="namaTempat">3. Alltime Buns</p>
        <img src="WhatsApp Image 2024-08-02 at 20.54.36.jpeg" width="200" height="300">
        <aside>
            <p class="desc">Alltime Buns is a burger restaurant. For me, its burger has an authentic taste, the patty is so meaty and juicy. You guys can try this if you wanna try american style burger, not that fast food kinda burger. Please note that the portion is pretty big, so don't forget to come here when your stomach is empty enaugh or you can share it with your friend.</p>
        </aside>
        <p class="namaTempat">4. Kup Ramen</p>
        <img src="WhatsApp Image 2024-08-02 at 20.55.18 (1).jpeg" width="200" height="300">
        <aside>
            <p class="desc">If you have a bad day, you must try to eat this ramen. It has thick chicken broth that makes the ramen tastes delicious. I tried the shoyu chicken ramen and the roasted chicken is quite big. Its portion is just perfect for me, not too big and not too small. The price is also still reasonable and worth the portion and quality. After you eat, the waitress will give you a questionnaire paper so you can give any feedback for this restaurant. It's a good thing for me because it means that the restaurant will always improve their quality to be better and better again. The weakness of this place is just the ambience. For me the place is quiet dark and hot, maybe it's also because it is located inside Pasar Tunjungan.</p>

        <img src="WhatsApp Image 2024-08-02 at 20.55.18.jpeg" width="200" height="300">
        <aside>
            <p class="desc">This one is a cafe and it screams for a pricy cafe. But trust me it will worth the price. They serve high quality and yummy foods. This cafe isn't a cafe where you can come to everyday but you can try to eat here at least once. The service is really good and also the ambience is. When you have a day when you crave for fancy foods you can come here and try their dishes.</p>
